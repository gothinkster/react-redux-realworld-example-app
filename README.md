# ![React + Redux Example App](project-logo.png)

> Example React + Redux codebase that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

# Redux codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc)
Originally created for this [GH issue](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1353). The codebase is now feature complete and the RFC is open. **Your input is greatly appreciated; please submit bug fixes via pull requests & feedback via issues**.

We're currently working on some docs for the codebase (explaining where functionality is located, how it works, etc) but most things should be self explanatory if you have a minimal understanding of React/Redux.

## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://react-redux.realworld.io/

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://conduit.productionready.io/api for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://github.com/GoThinkster/productionready/blob/master/API.md) which contains all routes & responses for the server. We'll release the backend code in a few weeks should anyone be interested in it.

## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a live demo over at https://redux.productionready.io/

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /#/ )
    - List of tags
    - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
    - Pagination for list of articles
- Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /#/login, /#/register )
    - Use JWT (store the token in localStorage)
- Settings page (URL: /#/settings )
- Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /#/editor, /#/editor/article-slug-here )
- Article page (URL: /#/article/article-slug-here )
    - Delete article button (only shown to article's author)
    - Render markdown from server client side
    - Comments section at bottom of page
    - Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)
